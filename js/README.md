0. How to output JS ? 
1. Variables 
2. Data Types : Strings and Boolean expressions 
3. Comparison and Logical Operators 
4. Programming as expressions : (Functions)


## Expressions && Statements 
### Expressions 
This is any piece of code that produces a value. (Simple value, combination of values ,
or a more complex structure)

5; //fixed/literal value
x + y; //arithmetic expression
"Hello, " + x; //string concatenation
true && false; //logical expression

usage : 
Expressions are used in statements, as values to be assigned , compared or manipulated

### Statement 
This is a larger unit of code that produces an action. Statements do not have to produce a 
value but it can include expressions 

let k = 5; //variable declaration and assignment 
if/else; //conditional statements 
for/while; //loops statements
